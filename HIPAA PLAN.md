Alright, let’s make it so **anyone, even non-tech**, could follow the steps and tick them off. Think of it like a **household chores list** but for HIPAA readiness.

# 🏥 HIPAA To-Do List (Plain English)

### **Step 1. Get permission from your tools**

* Ask AWS (or Google/Azure) for a **HIPAA contract (BAA)**.
* Ask your AI provider (Gemini, Bedrock, Azure OpenAI) if they sign HIPAA contracts.
* Only use tools that agree to sign.
  ✅ Done when: You have written agreements saying they handle health data safely.

### **Step 2. Lock the storage**

* Make sure all files are stored in a **locked folder** (S3 bucket) that is:

  * Not public (nobody can just Google the link).
  * Automatically encrypted (turned into secret code).
* Make sure uploads and downloads happen over **https\://** only.
  ✅ Done when: You try opening a file link in another browser and it says **Access Denied**.

---

### **Step 3. Keep track of “who did what”**

* Every time someone uploads, downloads, deletes, or generates something → write it in a log (like a diary).
* Log should include: **who, what, when**.
  ✅ Done when: You can show a table of activities (like: “User123 uploaded file X on Jan 3 at 2:14 pm”).

### **Step 4. Auto-delete old files**

* Set a rule: after 30/60/90 days, old files are auto-deleted.
* Make sure delete button actually removes the file everywhere (not just hiding it).
  ✅ Done when: You delete a file and after 5 minutes the link no longer works.

### **Step 5. Write a “what if” plan**

* Write one page that answers:

  1. How do you notice a break-in?
  2. What’s the first thing you do? (freeze the account)
  3. How do you check what happened? (look at logs)
  4. Who do you tell, and when? (users within 60 days)
     ✅ Done when: You can explain this plan in 1 minute to a friend.

### **Step 6. Store only what’s needed**

* Only save the minimum: PDF text chunks, page numbers, and embeddings.
* Don’t save names, addresses, or extra health info if you don’t need it.
  ✅ Done when: You can point to your database and show it only has **document text + page refs**, nothing personal.

---

### **Step 7. Do a test run**

* Upload a fake patient report (with dummy data).
* Ask questions, generate a doc, delete the file.
* Check:

  * Was it encrypted?
  * Was it logged?
  * Was it deleted when you asked?
    ✅ Done when: All answers are yes.

---

## 🎯 End Result

* Your tools agree to handle health data.
* Files are locked + auto-deleted.
* Logs show every action.
* You have a clear “what if” plan.
* You only keep what’s needed.
* You tested it and it worked.

That’s HIPAA readiness in **plain, checklist form**.
