## 🚨 **Critical Safety Features Added**

After audit, identified **28 missing safety rails** that separate demo from production:

### **Product Safety (7 items):**
- Empty state + sample doc for first-run
- Failed states + Retry for uploads/jobs  
- Delete document with confirmation
- Ask across collections (not just single docs)
- "I don't know" rule when no relevant content found
- Exact citations with Sources panel highlighting
- Share/export with expiring view-only links

### **Credits & Billing Safety (3 items):**
- Idempotent Stripe webhooks (store event_id)
- Race-safe credit deduction (request_id + DB transaction)
- Refund on no-answer (don't charge for "I don't know")

### **Ingestion Safety (3 items):**
- Versioned ingestion runs with idempotency
- Retry with backoff + dead-letter queue
- Per-page metadata on every chunk

### **Retrieval Quality (3 items):**
- Score threshold (reject low-relevance matches)
- TOP_K and token caps for controlled responses
- Prompt engineering for citations or "don't know"

### **Storage & Access (3 items):**
- Pre-signed URLs only (no public files)
- User-scoped data access on all queries
- File size limits with early rejection

### **Observability (3 items):**
- Audit logs for all sensitive actions
- Request IDs in logs for tracing
- Health/metrics page for monitoring

### **Rate Limits & Abuse (3 items):**
- Simple per-user rate caps
- Input validation with friendly errors
- Empty prompt blocking

### **Deployment Safety (3 items):**
- Environment validation at boot
- Seed script for test data
- Graceful error handling

## 📋 **New Simple Milestones Created**

Created `SimpleRealMilestones.md` with **18 outcome-focused milestones**:
- Each milestone = 30-second testable outcome
- Covers all safety features and core functionality
- Written as "what you can see/test" not technical implementation
- Final test: complete stranger can use app in under 5 minutes

```sql
Tables Created:
├── users           # User accounts with email auth
├── documents       # PDF metadata and processing status  
├── chunks          # Text chunks with vector embeddings
├── conversations   # Chat sessions (document/collection scope)
├── messages        # Chat history with citations
├── credits         # User credit balances
├── transactions    # Credit transaction history (idempotent)
├── webhook_events  # Stripe webhook deduplication
├── ingestion_runs  # PDF processing job tracking
└── audit_logs      # Action logging for security
```

### ✅ **Enhanced Header & UX**
